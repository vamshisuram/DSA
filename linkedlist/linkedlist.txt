Arrays 
- fixed size
- if size over - adding an element needs creation of new array.

LinkedList
- not contiguous, can't random access 
- not cache friendly (how cache works?)
- extra memory for next node link

API
- printList

Underlying data storage implementation?
- use array to store data  // since we are coming from -ve side of Array, don't use this.
- add - just array.push
- remove - loop and splice
- print - loop and print
