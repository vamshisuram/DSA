parent val is always > or < than the children

we can implement this using linkedlist also, have extra property like weightage/priority

priority queue
- we remove the first element always. O(1)
- but insertion takes O(n) - just like routine.

Heap is the most efficient data structure when we want to store/maintain data which maintains order.
